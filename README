== Dropio Unlimited API client demo app

This is a small demo app to show how easy it is to build drop.io's uploading, conversion, storage, and delivery to your own applications. This app is intentionally simple and serves to illustrate how to get assets into and out of drops, and also how you can wrap the converted assets in 3rd party players to provide a seamless, unbranded experience to your users while using drop.io's simple API.
